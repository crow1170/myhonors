		<p>We allow students to attach letters of recommendation to their online application to the Honors College at FIU as long as the letters come directly from their author. For this to work we depend on the trust between us and our applicants. We're deeply sorry that trust has been violated. The student who provided your email address has been logged and their application will now receive a lower priority.</p>
